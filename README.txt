Both group members worked on everything together in person, so we could
collaborate and share ideas more easily. The only exception was in part 1, for 
the extra five points when both team members make a commit by  Sunday at midnight;
that part was done separately.

The improvements we made to our AI were improving our heuistic by adding more 
weight to the corners, and we also implemented a variation of the minimax algorithm
that to go to a 6-ply depth.
The reason we think this could work is because we make sure to position ourselves to
control the edge pieces, which tend to dominate the game.
